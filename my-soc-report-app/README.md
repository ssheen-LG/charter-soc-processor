# My SOC Report App

This is a simple web application to view SOC reports.

## Running Locally

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## Deploying to Vercel

To deploy a new version of the application to Vercel, run the following command:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

This will create a new production deployment. You will need to have the Vercel CLI installed and be logged in to your Vercel account.
